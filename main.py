#  1. Fill the pg window with Sudoku Board i.e., Construct a 9Ã—9 grid. 
# 2. Fill the board with default numbers. 
# 3. Assign a specific key for each operations and listen it. 
# 4. Integrate the backtracking algorithm into it. 
# 5. Use set of colors to visualize auto solving.

in hidden single, if i find a HS on a row, why am i checking col+cell? maybe have a shared list that is checked for len(1) -> stripping, or if not, refresh as i check other avenues
when logic is applied, have text saying which logic and where
